The User Authentication program is designed to securely authenticate users and grant them access to
protected resources. It provides a secure way for users to verify their identities and ensures that
only authorized individuals can access sensitive information or perform specific actions within the
system.

The program offers a streamlined and user-friendly authentication process. Users can create an
account by providing their personal information and selecting a unique username and password. The
program employs industry-standard security practices to securely store user credentials, such as
hashing and salting techniques.

Once registered, users can log in to their accounts using their chosen credentials. The program
verifies the provided username and password combination, granting access only if the credentials
match the stored information. Failed login attempts are logged and may trigger additional security
measures, such as temporary account lockouts or CAPTCHA challenges, to prevent unauthorized access.

Upon successful authentication, users gain access to various features and resources based on their
assigned roles and permissions. These roles determine the level of access and functionality
available to each user within the system. For example, administrators may have elevated privileges
to manage user accounts, while regular users have limited access to their own personal data.

To ensure transparency and compliance, the program also provides comprehensive documentation
accessible via the following link: https://incode.onrender.com/auth-docs/. The documentation
outlines the program's functionalities, API endpoints, data models, and any additional instructions
or guidelines for developers or system administrators.

By implementing the User Authentication program, organizations can establish a secure and reliable
method for verifying user identities, safeguarding sensitive information, and controlling access to
their systems and resources.
